All original credit goes to [obsrv.org](https://www.obsrv.org/) team, the following content is a simplification from guide taken from [gh0stline GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gh0stl1ne)
Official thread about this on [obsrv.org forum](http://www.obsrv.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5251)

## Requirements

- Linux based system (This guide uses Debian)
- Custom build of Apache HTTP Server
- Custon build of OpenSSl with weak cipher (Apache Build Prereq)
- DNAS Emulation uses old protocol HTTP/1.0
- Install VIM for file edit or use nano if you prefer (Debian: `apt install vim`)
- Install screen for observice.sh script usage (Debian: `apt install screen`)
- Install git for repo clone (Debian: `apt install git`)

## Setting up weak ciphers

### Compiling OpenSSL

- Download OpenSSL `cd && wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2q.tar.gz`
- Extract to you home folder `tar xzvf openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz`
- Access extracted folder `cd openssl-1.0.2g`
- Setup make using config `./config --prefix=/opt/openssl-1.0.2 --openssldir=/etc/ssl shared enable-weak-ssl-ciphers enable-ssl3 enable-ssl3-method enable-ssl2 -Wl,-rpath=/opt/openssl-1.0.2/lib`
- Execute make to build `make`
- Install on system `sudo make install` or just `make install`
- Test if have the needed cipher with `/opt/openssl-1.0.2/bin/openssl ciphers -V 'ALL' | grep 0x13`
    Expected result:

    ```text
    0xC0,0x13 - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA    SSLv3 Kx=ECDH     Au=RSA  Enc=AES(128)  Mac=SHA1
    0x00,0x13 - EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA    SSLv3 Kx=DH       Au=DSS  Enc=3DES(168) Mac=SHA1
    ```

### Compiling Apache 2

- Need to setup the OpenSSL lib to be used with Apache, so edit the ld file with this command `vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/$(uname -m)-linux-gnu.conf` or `nano /etc/ld.so.conf.d/$(uname -m)-linux-gnu.conf` and add the following lines at the end and after execute the `ldconfig`

    ```conf
    # custom OpenSSL
    /opt/openssl-1.0.2/lib
    ```

- Use apt to install some prereqs `apt update && apt install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libexpat1 libexpat1-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libxslt1`
- Download Apache 2 `cd && wget http://mirror.nbtelecom.com.br/apache//httpd/httpd-2.4.43.tar.gz`
- Download Apache Apr `wget http://ftp.unicamp.br/pub/apache//apr/apr-1.7.0.tar.gz`
- Download Apache apr-util `wget http://ftp.unicamp.br/pub/apache//apr/apr-util-1.6.1.tar.gz`
- Extract it `tar xzvf httpd-2.4.43.tar.gz`
- Access srclib folder with `cd ~/httpd-2.4.43/srclib/`
- Extract Apr with `tar xzvf ~/apr-1.7.0.tar.gz`
- Extract Apr-util with `tar xzvf ~/apr-util-1.6.1.tar.gz`
- Make symlink of extracted Apr with `ln -s apr-1.7.0 apr`
- Make symlink of extracted Apr-util with `ln -s apr-util-1.6.1 apr-util`
- Go back one folder with `cd ..`
- Execute make configure script with `./configure --prefix=/opt/apache --with-included-apr --with-ssl=/opt/openssl-1.0.2 --enable-ssl` (download and uppack apr-util in \srclib\ error)
- Build with `make` and after just install with `make install`
- Execute `vi /opt/apache/bin/envvars` and add the line with OpenSSL lib line with the following:

    # envvars-std - default environment variables for apachectl
    #
    # This file is generated from envvars-std.in
    #
    if test "x$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" != "x" ; then
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/apache/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    else
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/apache/lib"
    fi
    # Add the below line between "fi" and "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/openssl-1.0.2/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    #
    ```

- Create a systemd service for apache server with `vi /etc/systemd/system/apache.service` and add the following:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Apache Server for Outbreak

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    EnvironmentFile=/opt/apache/bin/envvars
    PIDFile=/opt/apache/logs/httpd.pid
    ExecStart=/opt/apache/bin/apachectl -k start
    ExecReload=/opt/apache/bin/apachectl graceful
    ExecStop=/opt/apache/bin/apachectl -k stop
    KillSignal=SIGCONT
    PrivateTmp=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

- Enable the new created service with `systemctl enable apache.service`
- And start it with `systemctl start apache`
- Check in you browser with `http://127.0.0.1` (replace with your IP)
- If show `Its works!` it means that all fine for now

## Setting up DNS

- Install dnsmasq and dnsutils with `apt update && apt install dnsmasq dnsutils`
- Execute `mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.backup`
- Execute `vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf` and add following:

    ```conf
    # Replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with your machine IP Address
    address=/gate1.jp.dnas.playstation.org/XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    address=/www01.kddi-mmbb.jp/XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    server=8.8.8.8
    server=1.1.1.1
    interface=eth0
    listen-address=::1,127.0.0.1,XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    ```

- Edit with `vi /etc/hosts` and add the following lines (replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX your IP)

    ```text
    127.0.0.1       dnsmasq
    127.0.1.1       dnsmasq
    XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX  dnsmasq
    ```

- Restart dnsmasq with `systemctl restart dnsmasq`

## Cloning this Repo

- Clones this repo with `git clone https://github.com/adrianopteodoro/obsrv-pack.git`
- And enter on the repo folder with `cd obsrv-pack`

## Installing and setting up DNAS

- On repo folder execute this `mv DNAS/etc/dnas /etc/dnas` to move the DNAS etc folder
- Execute `chown -R 0:0 /etc/dnas` to set permissions
- Execute `mkdir /var/www` to create the www folder
- Execute `mv DNAS/www/dnas /var/www/dnas` to move www DNAS folder
- Execute `chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/dnas` to set permissions
- Now we need to setup Apache to execute PHP scripts, install with `apt update && apt install php7.0-fpm`
- Edit apache config file with `vi /opt/apache/conf/httpd.conf`
- Search and uncomment the following lines (look for each one because its not in sequence):

    ```conf
    #LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
    #LoadModule proxy_fcgi_module modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so
    #LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
    #LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
    ```

- Replace this:

    ```conf
    <IfModule unixd_module>
    #
    # If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
    # httpd as root initially and it will switch.
    #
    # User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
    # It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for
    # running httpd, as with most system services.
    #
    User daemon
    Group daemon

    </IfModule>
    ```

    With this:

    ```conf
    <IfModule unixd_module>
    #
    # If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
    # httpd as root initially and it will switch.
    #
    # User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
    # It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for
    # running httpd, as with most system services.
    #
    User www-data
    Group www-data

    </IfModule>
    ```

- Add the following to the end on file (replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX your IP):

    ```conf
    <IfModule ssl_module>
        # Replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with your machine IP Address
        Listen XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:443
        SSLEngine on
        # nail it to the securest cipher PS2 understands DHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA
        # check this with openssl
        SSLCipherSuite DHE:!DSS:!AES:!SEED:!CAMELLIA!TLSv1.2
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/dnas/cert-jp.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/dnas/cert-jp-key.pem
        SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/dnas/ca-cert.pem
        ServerName gate1.jp.dnas.playstation.org

        </Directory>
        <Directory "/var/www/dnas">
            Options -Indexes
            Require all granted

### Test with your game

- You will need a Outbreak File 1 or File 2 Japan version
- You will need network file set to use your DNS (For network setup on PS is better to use another game that has built-in network setup or use a `Network Adaptor Start-Up Disc` to do that)
- For emulator you need to use [CLR_DEV9 plugin](https://github.com/TheLastRar/CLR-DEV9) to use with [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/)
- Youtube has several guides about that piece at end only only need is just swap the DNS address to use your own
